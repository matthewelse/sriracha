</p>

## Introduction

Sriracha is a library for type-safe hot-reloading of OCaml functions, inspired by
[subsecond](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/main/packages/subsecond).

## Usage

See [example](example/example.ml) for a working example.

üå∂Ô∏è `sriracha` üå∂Ô∏è requires you to tweak the way you start your application, at
least when you want to run it for the purposes of live-reloading.

You should write a `main` function with type `unit -> unit Async.Deferred.t`, and
annotate any hot-reloadable functions with `let%hot`.

> Note that any hot-reloadable functions require explicit type annotations, and require
> `Core` and `ppx_typerep_conv` to be available (since we use `Typerep.t` to ensure
> type-safety under the hood).

```ocaml
open! Core
open! Async

let%hot reloadable () : unit =
  print_endline "hello, world!"
;;

let main () =
  Clock_ns.every Time_ns.Span.second (fun () -> reloadable ());
  Deferred.never ()
;;

let () = Sriracha.with_hot_reloading main
```

I'd suggest building your app as a _library_ with [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune),
and for testing purposes, build the loader app from this repo. You should then be able to
run the app with live reloading as follows (these commands work if you run them in this repo):

```bash
# run this in one terminal
$ dune build example/example.cmxs loader/bin/loader.exe --auto-promote --watch

# in another terminal
$ _build/default/loader/bin/loader.exe _build/default/example/example.cmxs
```

Then, make edits to `example.ml` (e.g. changing the text printed by `reloadable`). Notice
how only changes in, or "downstream" of `reloadable` affect the runtime behaviour.

## How it works

Sriracha makes use of the OCaml [`Dynlink`](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.3/api/Dynlink.html#top)
library. It builds a type-safe jump table from function name to function pointer, and redirects
calls to hot-reloadable functions via the jump table. This jump table is updated as the program
live reloads.

## Ideas

- [ ] add a flag to `ppx_sriracha` to statically remove all of the hot-reloading points in
  release builds.
- [ ] handle nested function calls correctly (e.g. detect a new function being called
  within an old function.
- [ ] add some better notes about caveats/limitations of the library, e.g. the interaction
  with global state, etc.
- [ ] build a more complete example, e.g. a web server with Dream.
